# React Native FlatList Performance and Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets and complex item rendering. The bug manifests as random crashes, freezes, inconsistent rendering, or slow scrolling.

## Bug Description

The `FlatList` component, while efficient for smaller datasets, can struggle with large datasets and complex item components. This is because it relies on efficient recycling of rendered items.  Inefficient rendering or improper usage of keys can lead to significant performance problems.

## Solution

This repository provides a solution by improving the efficiency of item rendering and proper key handling.  Key improvements:

* **Efficient Item Rendering:**  Using techniques like `React.memo` to memoize components and avoid unnecessary re-renders.  Optimizing the render function to minimize calculations.
* **Proper Key Usage:** Ensuring that a unique `key` is provided for each item, crucial for efficient rendering and recycling by `FlatList`.
* **Virtualization:** If necessary, exploring more advanced virtualization techniques to improve memory usage and performance.
